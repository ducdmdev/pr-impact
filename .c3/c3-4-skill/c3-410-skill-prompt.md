# Skill Prompt

## Goal

Assembled analysis prompt from shared templates. Defines the `/pr-impact` slash command experience — the same analysis methodology as the GitHub Action but delivered interactively.

## Container Connection

This is the entire user-facing product of the skill package. Without it, the `/pr-impact` command would have no instructions for Claude.

## Dependencies

| Direction | What | From/To |
|-----------|------|---------|
| IN (uses) | `templates/system-prompt.md`, `templates/report-template.md` | Shared templates |
| OUT (provides) | `/pr-impact` slash command prompt | Claude Code runtime |

## Code References

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/build-skill.ts` | Build script that assembles skill.md (38 lines) |
| `packages/skill/skill.md` | Generated output (auto-generated, do not edit) |
